This is interesting, but it obfuscates other modes. If we want to study the other ways Earth’s climate varies, we should remove the seasonal cycle from our data.

Terminology varies across texts, but here we will refer to the spatial patterns as “EOFs” and the time series as the “principal components” (PCs).\n\nEach EOF-PC pair can be thought of as a mode of variability in the data, but it is not necessary that these modes represent something physical.

In matrix notation, we can write each map of M locations as the column vector \\mathbf{f}_n=\\begin{bmatrix}f_{1n} & f_{2n} & \\cdots & f_{Mn}\\end{bmatrix}^\\mathrm T, where n=1, \\dots, N.

This generalizes such that the vector space \\mathbf F is spanned by an arbirary unit basis \\{\\mathbf u_1,\\mathbf u_2,\\dots,\\mathbf u_M\\}. It is very likely that some of the vectors \\mathbf f_n are correlated as a result of some physical process.

The optimization condition implies(\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T\\mathbf R\\mathbf e=0\n\nBy the orthonormality of the basis, we also require that these variations only change the direction of \\mathbf e, so (\\mathbf e+\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T(\\mathbf e+\\delta\\mathbf e)=1\\Rightarrow(\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T\\mathbf e=0, again only keeping terms first order in \\delta\\mathbf e. We can combine these two conditions, provided that we multiply the orthonormality condition by a constant that has the same units as the entries of \\mathbf R:(\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T\\mathbf R\\mathbf e-\\lambda(\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T\\mathbf e=(\\delta\\mathbf e)^\\mathrm T[\\mathbf R\\mathbf e-\\lambda\\mathbf e]=0\n\nSince \\delta\\mathbf e is arbitrary, we must have \\mathbf R\\mathbf e-\\lambda\\mathbf e=0, the eigenvalue problem for \\mathbf R, or for nontrivial solutions, |\\mathbf R-\\lambda\\mathbf I|=0.\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/eof-intro#deriving-the-eigenvalue-problem","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to EOFs","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/eof-intro#summary","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to EOFs","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"In this notebook, we covered some background on EOFs, the steps required to carry out an EOF analysis, and some of the math behind the analysis.","type":"content","url":"/eof-intro#summary","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to EOFs","lvl3":"What’s next?","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/eof-intro#whats-next","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to EOFs","lvl3":"What’s next?","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"In the next notebook, we will use a package called \n\nxeofs to find climate modes in SST data.","type":"content","url":"/eof-intro#whats-next","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/how-to-cite","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"content":"The material in Project Pythia’s EOFs Cookbook is licensed for free and open consumption and reuse.
